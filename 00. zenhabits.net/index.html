        <h1>Getting Clarity of Purpose (plus: final day for $500 retreat discount)</h1>
        <p class = "author">BY LEO BABAUTA</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A client recently asked me how to get full clarity on their purpose — they don’t feel certain, and that lack of certainty makes it hard to fully commit themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            You might be able to relate: if you feel 100% sure that something is the right direction and is going to work out, you’re likely to be pretty motivated. But if you’re not sure … maybe the doubts have you hesitating.
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s that hesitation that gets us.
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem is that we don’t get clarity of purpose by just thinking about it. No amount of thinking, reading, or watching videos is going to get us clarity of purpose.
            <br>
            <br>
            The way to get clarity of purpose is to take your best shot at it — sit and reflect in silence, journal about it, talk to people about it, and then come up with something. Anything. Even if it feels completely uncertain.
            <br>
            <br>
            And then act as if you were 100% certain. Commit yourself as if you had an answer from the Gods. Take action. Pour your full self into it. And then see what happens.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you do this, you’ll get more clarity after taking committed action. You’ll learn something. Much more than if you took no action at all, or half-hearted action.
            <br>
            <br>
            So if you’re looking for clarity about your purpose … stop reading and watching stuff. Sit and reflect, and then choose from the heart. Then commit yourself fully, as if you had full clarity and confidence. And you’ll discover something profound from this.
